blink - cross-platform instruction encoding library

---------------------------------------------------

blink is a static library written in C that can write machine code bytes for a
variety of instruction sets directly to a file stream.

Currently supported instruction sets are:
	- mos6502
	- x86_64

Please note:

This library is a private project for use in my own software. It is in no way
complete and does not aim to be complete. MANY opcodes are missing and will
most likely never be implemented. Those that are implemented are probably
missing at least half of the valid encodings.

If you would like to add additional encodings or instruction sets, you are more
than welcome to modify the library and send me the changes via. email
(which you will find my address scattered at the top of my source files)
and I will happily incorporate the changes.

To install blink on a machine, read the INSTALL file.

blink is licensed under BSD 3-Clause.
All license information is available in the included COPYING file.
